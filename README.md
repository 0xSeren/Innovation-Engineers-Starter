# Innovation Engineers — Rover Programming Course

A hands-on robotics-programming course for the **ELEGOO Smart Robot Car V4.0**
(TB6612 + MPU6050 mainboard, Arduino UNO). The robot is already built — this
course is entirely about **programming, sensing, calibration, and autonomy**.

A **Day 0 warm-up** lets students drive the rover by hand (TeleOp). Days 1–2
then follow the **Bull City Robotics "Mars Rover Systems Engineering Lab"**
2-day camp (build sessions skipped — our rover is assembled), and Days 3–5
extend it into the engineering that makes autonomy actually work: calibration,
gyros, filtering, sensor fusion, and maze-solving algorithms.

> **Instructors:** the `instructor` branch holds the `TEACHING_GUIDE.md`
> (schedule, talking points, demos, failure modes, checkpoints) and worked
> `solutions/` for every exercise — kept off `main` so students get a clean
> starter. Switch with `git checkout instructor`.

## How the exercises work
Each `ExNN_*/ExNN_*.ino` is a **starter sketch that already compiles**. The
boilerplate (pins, motor helpers) is provided; the learning happens in the
numbered **`TODO` blocks**, which spell out exactly what each function must do.
Students fill those in, upload, and test. Worked solutions for every exercise
live on the `instructor` branch (`git checkout instructor`).

Day 0 is a short warm-up and can fold into the start of Day 1. Days 1–5 each
fill a camp-style day of four ~60–90 min sessions; cut the stretch goals to run
half-days.

## Calibration constants (set these before expecting good behavior)
These appear as `#define`s at the top of the sketches that use them:

- `MS_PER_CM`, `MS_PER_90_TURN`, `CM_PER_MS` — timing of forward/turn motion.
  Measure with a ruler + stopwatch (Exercise 2 teaches this).
- `LINE_THRESHOLD` / `LINE_IS_HIGH` — line-sensor cutoff and polarity
  (Exercise 8 replaces the guess with real per-sensor calibration).
- `TAPE_THRESHOLD` / `TAPE_READS_HIGH` — same idea for the Exercise 15 tape-wall
  maze (black tape on a light floor → tape reads "on"; flip if your contrast
  is reversed).
- `GYRO_SIGN` — flip `+1`↔`-1` if turns/heading go the wrong way.
- `PROBE_CM` — how far Exercise 15 glances down a side passage before calling it
  open. `CELL_CM` — maze grid pitch (cell-center spacing), for the Trémaux solver.

## Two kinds of maze (Day 5)
- **Exercises 14 & 16** use a **line maze**: the rover FOLLOWS tape lines and
  reads where they branch.
- **Exercise 15 (LSRB)** uses a **tape-wall maze**: walls are strips of tape laid
  ACROSS the corridors. The rover does **not** follow a line — it drives straight
  until all three sensors hit tape (a wall ahead), then pivots to glance left /
  right (it can't see sideways while driving) and turns. Lay corridors wide enough
  for the body (~18–20 cm) that end in walls/turns, and mark the finish with a
  solid tape **pad** (tape stays under all three sensors, unlike a thin wall line).

## Uploading
Board = **Arduino UNO**, Port = `/dev/ttyUSB0`. From the IDE, or:
```
arduino-cli upload -p /dev/ttyUSB0 --fqbn arduino:avr:uno <exercise-folder>
```
Open the **Serial Monitor / Serial Plotter** at 9600 baud — many exercises
print data meant to be watched there. (Exercise 0 is driven by the kit's IR
remote, not the keyboard.)

## Engineering Design Process
The camp's through-line, used at every step: **Imagine → Build → Test →
Improve.** Test on the real robot, find the weakest part, improve one thing,
retest.
